- [ ] Task 2.5: Implement `BufferManager` — write GPS record as JSONL to SD card → Verify: records appended to `/gps_buffer.jsonl` on SD
- [ ] Task 2.6: Implement `PowerManager` — ADC read of battery voltage, sleep mode triggers → Verify: battery % printed every 60s, modem sleep on low battery
- [ ] Task 2.7: Implement `WatchdogManager` — hardware WDT + per-task software ping — Verify: intentional task hang triggers WDT reboot within 30s
- [ ] Task 2.8: Implement `InternetManager` — HTTP HEAD to Supabase health endpoint to verify real connectivity → Verify: INTERNET_UP/INTERNET_DOWN event fires correctly
- [ ] Task 2.9: Wire FreeRTOS inter-task communication (GPS_Queue, LTE_EventGroup, Power_EventGroup) → Verify: upload manager wakes on INTERNET_UP event

- [ ] Task 4.4: Test watchdog recovery with forced crash (infinite loop in GPS task) → Verify: reboots within 30s, event logged in `system_events`
- [ ] Task 4.5: Verify NTP time sync — A7670 syncs time via LTE on connect → Verify: GPS record timestamps match real UTC within ±2s
- [ ] Task 4.6: Test rate limiting — send >10 requests/min from device → Verify: Edge Function returns 429 after threshold

## Notes

- **Device ID:** `GBT-001` (Garbage Truck 001)
- **APN:** Depends on SIM provider (Globe: `internet`, Smart: `internet`)
- **Supabase project pauses after 1 week inactivity** — set up a keepalive cron (GitHub Actions or Vercel cron) that pings the health endpoint every 3 days
- **GPS:** If A7670 built-in GPS is unreliable indoors, add external u-blox M8N on UART2
- **OTA updates:** Phase 2 feature — implement after field test is stable
- **Geofencing / alerts:** Phase 2 roadmap — architecture already supports it via PostGIS `ST_Contains`
